## Team introduction :star2:
Hello from Group 2!

We are a dynamic and aspiring group of six student engineers diving into the world of software and computer engineering. For our ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering course we are assigned to design, develop, and deliver a cutting-edge web app for a local sports center.

Tasked by the sports center owner, our goal is to create a user-friendly platform allowing seamless management of classes, scheduling, and customer registrations. From cardio to goat yoga, our app will empower instructors to propose and manage diverse sessions, subject to owner approval.

As a devoted team, we will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution, implement the system, and establish a release pipeline for automated software delivery. Together, we are poised to redefine the sports center's operations.

## Scope of the project :calling:
The scope of our project is to design, develop, and deliver a comprehensive web application for a local sports center, catering to the needs of multiple stakeholders: the owner, instructors, and customers. The primary objectives include:

- Allow the owner and instructors to manage different types of classes
- Permit the creation and proposal of new types of classes contigent on the approval of the owner
- Allow customers to register for their desire sessions and classes
- Ensure a seamless and intuitive interface for each stakeholder, promoting efficient interaction.

By the final deliverable, our team will deliver a robust, functional, and user-friendly appliation that enhances the sport center's operational efficiency and refines the experience of all stakeholders.

For more information about the web application, please consult the [wiki](../../wiki).
