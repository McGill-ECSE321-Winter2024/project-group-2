# Group 2

## Team introduction :bust_in_silhouette:
Hello from Group 2!

We are a dynamic and aspiring group of six student engineers diving into the world of software and computer engineering. For our ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering course we are assigned to design, develop, and deliver a cutting-edge web app for a local sports center.

Tasked by the sports center owner, our goal is to create a user-friendly platform allowing seamless management of classes, scheduling, and customer registrations. From cardio to goat yoga, our app will empower instructors to propose and manage diverse sessions, subject to owner approval.

As a devoted team, we will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution, implement the system, and establish a release pipeline for automated software delivery. Together, we are poised to redefine the sports center's operations.
